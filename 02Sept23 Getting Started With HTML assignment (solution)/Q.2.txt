Comments in HTML:-

Comment in HTML is used to write some explation in the code so we understand the code and also the other person can understand the code. For example: comment on code "this is a navigation bar of website".

Comment are also used if we do not render some code of HTML in the webpage so we can comment this part of code.

The comment in HTML is written as: 

<!-- This is HTML comments -->

Comments are two types :

2. Multi line Comments

Multi line comments is similar to single line comment. But it is used for large code.

Also comments are used for some other purpose like : finding an error in code & etc.
